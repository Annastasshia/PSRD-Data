Its normal method of attack is to creep into range to make slam attacks, then push opponents against other walls and crush them to death. Living walls follow basic orders and are normally used to block access to certain parts of their creator's lair&mdash;to get through a living wall, it must be killed and hacked apart to create a space other creatures can pass through. Living walls can be ordered to stack themselves on top of each other to reach higher ceilings, but this requires a ramp to allow one to climb onto the other.</p>"
