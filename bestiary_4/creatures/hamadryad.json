All nonevil woodland creatures acknowledge her as the wisest of dryads and respect her gifts of healing and diplomacy. In most forests, a hamadryad is the sister or wife of an erlking, and represents the protective, patient, and nurturing aspect of nature. With her healing magic, she can relieve the suffering of a dryad whose tree has been killed and sustain her long enough for her to bond with another tree.</p>"
