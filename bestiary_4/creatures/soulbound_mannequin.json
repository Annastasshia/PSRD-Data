The binding process is sophisticated enough to leave much of the soul's personality intact. Most are crafted to allow a faithful servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a dying loved one to remain among the living in a limited way. Because the mannequin's face is expressionless and its voice has little inflection, it carries several masks that it uses to convey emotions. It often serves its creator as a bodyguard, companion, servant, sentry, or even paramour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"construction\">Construction</h2>\n<p>A soulbound mannequin is made from wood or porcelain, with one expertly carved mask worth at least 500 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a creature who dies at some point during the creation of the mannequin (this doesn't prevent the rest of the soul from continuing on to the afterlife or prevent the body from later being revived). An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a successful DC 20 Will save.</p>\n<p class=\"stat-block-title\">Soulbound Mannequin</p>\n<p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Price</b> 16,500 gp</p>\n<p class=\"stat-block-breaker\">Construction</p>\n<p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Requirements</b> Craft Construct, <i>disguise self</i>, <i>false life</i>, <i>lesser geas</i>, <i>magic jar</i>, <i>minor creation</i>, soul of a living creature who dies or is slain during the creation process; <b>Skill</b> Craft (sculptures); <b>Cost</b> 8,500 gp</p>\n</li></li></li></li></li>"
