When a geist enters a haunt's area of effect, the geist can immediately attempt to take over the haunt by making a Charisma check.

If the geist's attempt to take control of a haunt fails, the geist must retreat from the haunt's area of effect and cannot attempt to take control of the haunt again for 24 hours. When a geist controls a haunt, it can activate or suppress the haunt's effects as a free action and the haunt automatically resets in half its normal time. A haunt under a geist's control can still be neutralized when reduced to 0 hit points, but it cannot be permanently put to rest until the geist that controls it is destroyed. A geist can control a number of haunts up to its Charisma modifier at one time (usually five).",
