Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage.When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the swarm's control.
