Sailors often advise launching ocean voyages only during the day on the assumption that doing so might protect them from the sea bonze's attention, but such tactics make little difference to the creature itself, which will trail a particular ship until after dusk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, only to lurch out of the water and lay waste to an entire ship.</p>"

Reawakened as mammoth ship-wreckers, these angry spirits have no memory of their past lives, and seek to inflict the doom they suffered on others who ply the seas. Their hatred does not make them mindless, however, and more than one lucky crew member has talked her entire ship's way out of total annihilation. Sea bonzes have an unusual respect for those with wit and guile, and will sometimes consider sparing those they deem worthy of their esteem. Those who try to defend themselves with brawn and weapons, however, receive no mercy from the enormous monsters.</p>"
