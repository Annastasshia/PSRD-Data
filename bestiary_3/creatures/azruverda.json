Attempting to control a vermin is a standard action&mdash;the vermin can resist this attempt with a DC 25 Will save.  If the vermin fails this save, the azruverda can issue a simple mental command like \"fight,\" \"come here,\" \"go there,\" or \"stand still\" as a swift action. Though composed of thousands of individuals, vermin with the swarm subtype are vulnerable to this ability as well. An azruverda can release a creature from this control as a free action. Vermin affected by this ability act normally unless an azruverda is actively controlling it, but never attack their master azruverda. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
