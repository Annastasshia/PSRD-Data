At a range of up to 20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of determining penalties from two-weapon fighting.",
