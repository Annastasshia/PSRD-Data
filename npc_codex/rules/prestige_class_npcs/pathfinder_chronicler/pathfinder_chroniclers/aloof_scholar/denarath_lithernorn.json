They give their opinions and observations directly and without deceit or the vagaries of tone, and never talk back when she disagrees with their opinions. Unfortunately for Denarath, chronicles are by definition the stories of other people and their deeds, so she needs to deal with other people for her work. She puts up with them with a quiet and detached reserve, waiting for them to perform deeds worthy of being immortalized in her prose. She takes an equal interest in all types of martial and magical prowess, and encourages allies to invite new, different members into their group.</p>",
