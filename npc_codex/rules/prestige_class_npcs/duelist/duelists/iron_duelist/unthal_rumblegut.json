            "body": "<p>Born into a family of miners, Unthal learned at an early age that when wielded properly, the pick could become an effective weapon. When his clan's mines dug too deep into the Darklands, he was forced to defend his family mines against duergar and drow incursions, working with shielded defenders to lunge out from protective shield walls, using his mobility to take down dangerous foes before moving back behind the moveable walls of iron and dwarven muscle. His unorthodox tactics were mocked at first, with some seeing him as cowardly for not standing and fighting with feet planted like a normal dwarven warrior, but as the corpses of the clan's enemies mounted into piles, then great mounds, the whispers and jokes died. Now he enjoys high status within his clan, and teaches his ways to a new generation of dwarves, occasionally making pilgrimages out onto the surface to take his tactics to other holds.</p>",
