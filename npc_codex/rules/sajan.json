The siblings trained and served as partners, each complementing the other's technique, and became talented martial artists. After numerous victories, however, the siblings were separated when their lord was defeated, shamed, and forced to cede half his army to the victor&mdash;among them Sajan's sister. Sajni was taken away from Vudra by her new master and placed upon a ship as tribute to a distant lord. Daring disgrace or even death, Sajan abandoned his responsibilities to follow, so unwilling was he to condemn Sajni to life in the barbaric lands to the west. Eventually he tailed her all the way to Absalom, the City at the Center of the World, but lost her among the travelers and treasures of a hundred nations. Still, Sajan has not yet given up hope. He continues to seek any clue that might point him toward his sister, and has traveled far from Absalom and performed many heroic deeds in return for even the barest of rumors.</p>",
