He knows there is ugliness in the world that would destroy all beauty, so he has sworn to be a shield against these defilers. In his heart, he wants peace and serenity, and hopes that his words and deeds can turn away the forces of destruction. While many might see him as an idealistic hero, the truth is that Pindle values art more than people, and will happily steal or overlook suffering if it's necessary to preserve great art.</p>",
