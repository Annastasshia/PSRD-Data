He is primarily driven by hunger and the urge to corrupt others, though his sloth often gets the better of him. He is equally comfortable sleeping in a bed, in a sewer, or on a pile of corpses. When his laziness overcomes his violent tendencies, he is talkative but dull, concerned more with his inflated ego than anything of consequence.</p>",
