Having lost countless friends in his lifetime, he has given up on forming anything but the most casual attachments to others, and has transformed himself into an agent of death. Killing gives him no sense of satisfaction or pleasure&mdash;it is simply as common and routine as breathing. If he must kill others to reach his intended target, he does so without remorse or guilt.</p>",
