Their teachings of violence and scorn for life took hold, but their attempts to install obedience and inner discipline did not. Urguk mastered many of their techniques, but never in a fashion that pleased them. Frustrated by his failures and unwilling to let Urguk leave with intimate knowledge of their order, the monks decided to terminate their experiment.</p>",
