Flenta passes herself off as a fighter with sorcerous skills, pretending to be casting spells rather than activating magic items (a ruse that rarely fools those with knowledge of spellcasting). If confronted, she insists that she gets the job done regardless of her methods. Deep down, Flenta still hopes to someday unlock the magical potential she's sure she possesses, whatever it takes.</p>",
