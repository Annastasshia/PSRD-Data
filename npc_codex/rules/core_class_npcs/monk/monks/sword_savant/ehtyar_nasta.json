One of the rare weapon masters of the age, Ehtyar uses his art to protect the world from the horrors that live beyond reality. He is especially wary of the machinations of the creatures of the Shadow Plane, and travels that plane pursuing one conspiracy or another. When not on a mission, he does fighting form demonstrations for the enlightenment and entertainment of the young.</p>",
