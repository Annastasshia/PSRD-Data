A bleaching attempt with dangerous chemicals left her scarred, and her eyebrows and body hair never grew back. Arweena began learning arcane arts, using illusions to mask her true appearance. Finding it easy to fool people, Arweena began taking others' identities. Now only a core of her old self exists, her mind filled with hundreds of personalities and illusory costumes. She constantly asks, \"Who am I now?\" Arweena became an actor, and found fame as a handful of starlet sensations. Few know these multiple celebrities are all one woman.</p>",
