If a town is menaced by her favored prey, she swaggers in and demands an outrageous price for her services. Once the townsfolk agree, she murders the giants, claims her wages, and leaves the town impoverished. She's been fighting giants since she came of age, and she wants to collect at least one head from each type of giant to display in her trophy room.</p>",
