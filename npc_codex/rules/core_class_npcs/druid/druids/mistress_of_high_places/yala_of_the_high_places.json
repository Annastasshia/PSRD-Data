Abandoned by her parents at a young age because of the inconvenience her mixed heritage caused both their families, she was raised by a tribe of yetis, who quickly began venerating her when her druidic powers developed. Never feeling entirely comfortable with her role or the society of the great creatures, she now lives a solitary existence tending a remote shrine dedicated to winter and the mountains themselves. Her enchanted shield was a gift from a courting yeti chief, but she ultimately rejected his advances.</p>",
