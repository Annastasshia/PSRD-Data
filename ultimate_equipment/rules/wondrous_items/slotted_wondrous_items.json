Of course, a character may carry or possess any number of slotted items of the same type, but additional items have no effect until they are worn. Sometimes a slotted wondrous item must be worn for a period of time (typically 24 hours) before the item's full effect manifests. If a creature is missing the body part where a wondrous item is worn, it cannot use that type of slotted item. If a creature has multiple body parts that correspond to a single wondrous item slot, it can still only gain the benefit of one item of that slot.</p>",
