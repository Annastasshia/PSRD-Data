    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used. Unlike other types of ammunition, there is no chance to retrieve firearm ammunition that misses. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.</p>",
