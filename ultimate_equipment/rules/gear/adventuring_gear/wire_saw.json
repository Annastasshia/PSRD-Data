By feeding the wire around a deadbolt or small door bar, you can use the rings to quietly saw through the obstruction. The saw takes 10 minutes to cut through a 2-inch piece of wood or a 1-inch iron bar. A wire saw can cut through items with hardness 10 or less. After five uses, the abrasive wire is worn smooth and must be replaced (costing 25 gp).</p>",
