            "text": "<p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, a personality conflict results&mdash;item against character. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p><p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = the item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for 1 day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on, as determined by the GM). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:</p><ul><li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>\n<li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>\n<li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>\n<li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>\n<li>Magical protections and devices to safeguard the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>\n<li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>\n<li>That the character relinquish the item to a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li></ul><p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following:</p><ul><li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>\n<li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>\n<li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>\n<li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>\n<li>Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.</li></ul><p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p><p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are natural rivals, even with others of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with other intelligent magic items. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and such an intelligent item usually tries its best to mislead or distract its host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p><p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters that possess them, even though they might never successfully control their possessors. They might be powerless to force their demands, but most remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and preferences.</p>",

While no good creature would create a <i>metamagician's apprentice</i>, he or she can still wield one. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">The rod can be used as a <i>+1 light mace</i>.

The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a <i>metamagic rod</i>) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The rod can use <i>read magic</i> and <i>detect magic</i> at will. The <i>metamagician's apprentice</i> is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the <i>explosive runes</i> spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a <i>metamagician's apprentice</i> becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.</p>",
