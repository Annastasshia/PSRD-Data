    "body": "<p>The first step is to determine the amount of treasure you can budget for an encounter. Start by determining the overall Challenge Rating of the encounter and the advancement rate of the group. Refer to the Treasure Values per Encounter table to determine the base value of the treasure for an encounter in terms of gold pieces. You might wish to award greater treasures than what the value indicates. In such a case, hold back on awarding treasure for a number of encounters, in effect \"banking\" the value for one larger reward. Alternatively, you might decide to simply have a game with a higher amount of treasure in general, increasing all the base values by 50% or more.</p><p>After determining the base value of an encounter depending on its CR, next check the treasure line in the individual stat blocks for all creatures involved. In the case of mixed groups of enemies, use the most generous treasure entry. The treasure entry for the creatures involved affects the overall reward of the encounter as follows.</p>",
