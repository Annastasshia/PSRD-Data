You pour batter on it, close it, and place it on a fire or stove to cook. Some waffle irons have plates that imprint the waffle with a noble's coat of arms, a religious symbol, or a country's flag. A mithral waffle iron almost always bears a specific insignia rather than the generic waffle pattern. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron.</p>",
