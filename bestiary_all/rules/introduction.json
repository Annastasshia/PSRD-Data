In cases where a creature has specific magical gear assigned to it, the assumption is a medium game&mdash;if you play a fast or slow game, you'll want to adjust the monster's gear as appropriate. &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; treasure indicates the total value of the creature's treasure is that of a CR equal to the average party level, as listed on Table: Treasure Values per Encounter. &ldquo;Double&rdquo; or &ldquo;triple&rdquo; treasure indicates the creature has double or triple this standard value. &ldquo;Incidental&rdquo; indicates the creature has half this standard value, and then only within the confines of its lair. &ldquo;None&rdquo; indicates that the creature normally has no treasure (as is typical for an unintelligent creature that has no real lair, although such creatures are often used to guard treasures of varying amounts). &ldquo;NPC gear&rdquo; indicates the monster has treasure as normal for an NPC of a level equal to the monster's CR.</p>",
