            "text": "<p>If folk tales are to be believed, trolls are solitary brutes who empty the wildlands of prey, then rampage through border villages and far-flung homesteads, eating livestock and defenders alike and moving on only when the food runs out or defenders chase them off with flame. But rangers, druids, and other seasoned adventurers know that these isolated trolls are not the whole story. Deep in the wilderness, trolls live in traveling families led by ruthlessly pragmatic females, hunting the forests and fens in carefully managed patterns to avoid exhausting the land's bounty.</p><p>While it's true that trolls are generally dangerous, selfish, and wicked monsters, troll culture and society are a strange and complicated jumble of contradictions. Trolls care for their young, and viciously kill or exile any who threaten the tribe's survival. Those who are exiled tend to become even more dangerous to both the tribal unit and creatures outside the tribe, as they grow more daring and ravenous, treating any creature as prey, including other trolls. When such exiles make their way into more populated areas, their destructive exploits give rise to the tales commonly told about trolls. Trolls who work together are more cautious and likely to avoid civilization, but can still be an organized storm of carnage in unified hunts and raids. And when many tribes can unify under a troll monarch, the ground shakes with thundering troll feet and every scrap of edible material is torn up and gulped down to fill their bellies. Fortunately, such gatherings of trolls are rare affairs that often burn themselves out through infighting, the passing of the threat that united them, or eventual over-hunting.</p><p>Trolls average 14 feet tall when standing upright, but seem no more than 8 feet tall because they hunch forward, perpetually on the verge of knuckle-walking. They generally have greenish skin, matted hair, large tusks protruding from their lower jaws, and inky-black eyes. Several kinds of troll variants also possess adaptations to different environments (such as wintry lands, deep caves, and oceans). Trolls of different types typically do not feel any close kinship to one another.</p><p>A troll's greatest motivation is its constant, gnawing hunger. An adult troll needs to eat the equivalent of a large pig every day just to fuel its demanding metabolism. This constant consumption powers the ability that sets trolls apart from other giants: the effortless regeneration of damaged tissue. A troll can reattach its severed limbs or grow new ones within minutes, and even a hacked-apart troll can restore itself, given enough time. Since under ordinary circumstances trolls cannot die from injury, they are fearless in battle, aggressively attacking without fearing loss of life or limb. Trolls are well aware of the few ways in which they can be killed, but even when confronted by the possibility of death, they have a hard time comprehending that it could really happen to them.</p><p>It is extremely difficult to kill a troll as long as its regeneration is in effect, but there are several ways to temporarily impede the regeneration long enough for a troll to die, or to kill it via means other than direct physical damage. A troll who doesn't get enough to eat over the course of a few days loses its regeneration and becomes vulnerable, though a single adequate meal will bring it back into fighting trim, and starvation itself is a common cause of death for trolls. Drowning a troll is also effective. The two most common ways to negate a troll's regeneration, however, are fire and acid, both of which create horrible wounds that damage the flesh beyond the power of regeneration to repair. Burning the stumps and corpse of an unconscious troll is the best way to permanently kill the creature.</p><p>Female trolls are significantly larger than males and slightly more intelligent. Male trolls are usually solitary; female trolls are much more social, banding together into nomadic groups of two to four plus younglings. Female trolls are highly protective of their young and run off any male trolls who overstay their welcome as well as any other creatures that might pose a threat. However, female trolls turn a blind eye to the vicious fighting between young trolls, viewing it as a necessary part of toughening them up for adult life.</p><p>Sometimes an elder female troll who has mastered the magic arts will temporarily join a group to observe and test the female young for magical aptitude, often staying with the group until a promising juvenile reaches maturity, protecting her from the worst of the fighting if her strengths don't lie in that direction. Once the juvenile is mature enough to leave her group, she is trained in the ways of magic.</p><p>Unlike females, most male trolls spend much of their lives alone. At maturity they either leave on their own or are run off by the adult females. A solitary male usually finds a large territory that it uses as a hunting ground, building a lair in the center and driving off any other trolls or other monsters. Males usually leave their territory only to mate, and often woo by attempting to best other suitors in combat.</p><p>Trolls have simple religious beliefs; they usually revere a demon lord of storms and natural disasters. Priests of this faith use acid and fire to intentionally burn and mutilate themselves, leaving them with horrific disfiguring scars.</p><p>Trolls generally live in wilderness regions with heavy forests or rocky terrain where it's easier for them to surprise their prey. They try to maintain a distance between themselves and other major predators and intelligent creatures. Troll druids, known as troll furies, mind the health of an entire region and are always the first to realize emerging dangers from encroaching ogres, humans, or other outside forces.</p><p>Full statistics for trolls can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
