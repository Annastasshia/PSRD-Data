            "text": "<p>Among goblinkind, hobgoblins are generally considered the most civilized representatives, although the cruelty, destruction, and tyranny they perpetrate don't create a mutually beneficial society. Few species are so singularly dedicated to battle as the militaristic hobgoblins, whose entire culture and society are built around proving their martial superiority and fostering conflict wherever they go.</p><p>Hobgoblins possess the intelligence and sophistication their goblin cousins lack, and overcome their physical shortcomings when compared to bugbears by working efficiently in groups. Each tribe forms a small militia that raids towns and villages, an upstart army with ambitions of becoming a much greater force and sacking ever-larger settlements. Most of these roving bands of raiders are eventually rooted out by larger military and law enforcement forces or powerful parties of adventurers, but occasionally a hobgoblin commander realizes her vision of leading a large, regimented army comprising legions of hobgoblins from dozens of tribes, and marching to war against even the most militarily advanced and well-defended enemies.</p><p>Beyond spreading war through their own military conquests and incursions, hobgoblins also encourage other races and cultures toward more militant and war-mongering practices. Individual hobgoblins often integrate themselves into those cosmopolitan cities where they can find acceptance, almost always taking on violent jobs or assuming roles that allow them to sate their hunger for bloodshed. They might serve as intimidating enforcers for an underground crime syndicate, inspiring combatants in the bloodstained sands of the arena pit, or hired mercenaries in a military organization. In rare instances, a hobgoblin might even serve as a military strategist for a general or ruler who recognizes that the hobgoblin's innate ruthlessness and the harsh training he's received since childhood can present a unique advantage on the battlefield. In such instances, the hobgoblin advisor attempts to lead his liege ever toward war rather than away from it, even if he must lie or deceive in order to achieve the desired result.</p><p>Hobgoblins are generally wary of magic, especially arcane magic (which they refer to as \"elf magic\"). Instead, they prefer alchemy. Like an echo of goblins' obsession with fire, hobgoblins practice destructive alchemy that focuses on thrown splash weapons.</p><p>Typical hobgoblins stand only a few inches shorter than the average human, but what they lack in height they make up for in natural brawn. Most hobgoblins have gray skin, which darkens to a mossy green when exposed to the sun for extended periods of time. They often wear the clothes and armor of other humanoids they have defeated in battle or otherwise subjugated, adjusting such gear to fit their long arms and short legs.</p><p>Hobgoblins are born live after a gestation period of 6 months. Most hobgoblins are single births, though twins are not unheard of. Hobgoblin mothers tend to their infants' needs for only a few weeks, after which the child is forcibly weaned and raised in a nursery with its peers. A hobgoblin child grows much faster than its human counterpart, and is generally able to walk, speak basic Goblin, and fend for itself at about 6 months of age. Hobgoblin youths start their martial training when only a few years old. Such harsh conditions breed hardy soldiers, and those children who don't survive are seen as the necessary cost of building a strong and efficient army.</p><p>Hobgoblins rarely live to old age, as their violent lifestyle generally leads to death on the field of battle. Those who survive a career of war typically retire from active duty when they reach middle age, and either assume leadership roles within the hobgoblin military or serve as political advisors to a general or warlord. Even then, the inevitable weaknesses that come with old age eventually come to the notice of hobgoblins of lower standing, who take the opportunity to usurp their elders' roles. Such coups are generally not violent, but a hobgoblin removed entirely from the sphere of war generally falls ill within a few years and dies long before his body would otherwise give out.</p><p>For all hobgoblins' violent and destructive tendencies, their society is a true meritocracy, albeit a harsh and dangerous one for those who fail to prove their worth. All hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or pedigree, are granted exactly as much respect and authority as they earn through their martial prowess. Hobgoblins are ambitious and driven by an overwhelming urge to fight and spread war, but those who fill roles other than strictly military positions&mdash;blacksmiths, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, stable hands, and so on&mdash;understand that even their meager tasks are vital to the functioning of the larger army. Those hobgoblins who earn positions of power and influence must continue to prove their worthiness, as the slightest signs of weakness are exploited by the next person in line, ensuring that the army and hobgoblin society as a whole are always the strongest and most efficient they can be.</p><p>As a race, hobgoblins have the ability to build lasting settlements and a stable culture&mdash;they simply believe it's easier and more efficient to force those weaker than themselves to tend to their needs. Viewing themselves as superior to all other humanoids (including other goblinoids), hobgoblins take members of other races as slaves; they treat such slaves cruelly and regard them as having less value than even a bent and rusted blade. Captured enemy combatants are only rarely forced to serve in a hobgoblin army, as hobgoblins prefer the loyalty of their own kind. Hobgoblins also find it easier to take cultural innovations that they find useful from subjugated races than to create their own, for why make something new when it's already there?</p><p>Full statistics for hobgoblins can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
