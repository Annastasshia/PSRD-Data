If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn't have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes.</p><ul><li><i>Arms</i>The target takes no damage from the attack, but it drops one carried item of the swashbuckler's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet cannot be chosen.</li>\n<li><i>Head</i>: The target is confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><i>Legs</i>: The target is knocked prone. Creatures with four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li><i>Torso or Wings</i>: The target is staggered for 1 round.</li></ul>",
