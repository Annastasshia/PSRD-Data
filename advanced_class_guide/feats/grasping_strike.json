The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the enemy breaks free with a successful Strength check or an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's saving throw DC), whichever comes first.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can use this ability as a free action after you hit an enemy with an attack. This is a supernatural ability.</p>",
