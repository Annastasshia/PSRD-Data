The creature hit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become fatigued for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the target with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.</p>",
