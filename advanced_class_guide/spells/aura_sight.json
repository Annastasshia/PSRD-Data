The effect is similar to that of a <i>detect chaos/evil/good/law</i> spell, but <i>aura sight</i> does not require concentration, and it discerns an aura's location and power more quickly.</p><p>You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a creature's Hit Dice or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect evil</i> spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the aura's strength (one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect).</p><p><i>Aura sight</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.</p>",
