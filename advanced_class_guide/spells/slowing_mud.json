A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the <i>slow</i> effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as <i>create water</i> or <i>hydraulic push</i><span class=\"char-style-override-43\">APG</span>) removes all the mud in 1 round.</p><p>A <i>haste</i> effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the <i>haste</i>. <i>Slow</i> does not stack with the effects of <i>slowing mud</i>. This spell cannot counter or dispel <i>haste</i>.</p>",
