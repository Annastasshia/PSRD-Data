Furthermore, it catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round at the end of its turn each round until the creature dies. If the target is still asleep, the fire damage from this spell wakes it.</p><p>Only one of these spells can be in place on a creature at any time. This has no effect on creatures that don't sleep.</p>",
