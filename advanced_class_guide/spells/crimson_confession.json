A <i>detect magic</i> spell causes an invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled.</p><p><i>See invisibility</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, a <i>gem of seeing</i>, or a <i>robe of eyes</i> likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark. A <i>read magic</i> spell reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an <i>erase</i> spell.</p>",
