To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p><p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition's spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this transfer happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target afflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the rest of the duration or until cured.\n\t<ul>\n<li><i>Minor Conditions</i> (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</li>\n<li><i>Major Conditions</i> (DC 20): Dazed and staggered.</li>\n<li><i>Severe Conditions</i> (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</li>\n<li><i>Dire Conditions</i> (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</li>\n</ul>\n</p><p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of his choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p><p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a check at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level.
