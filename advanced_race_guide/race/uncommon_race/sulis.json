The flames have a range increment of 10 feet.</p><p id=\"icewalk-(cold)\"><i>Icewalk (cold)</i>: The suli can walk on water-based liquids as if using <i>water walk</i>, except instead of hovering above the surface, she creates a temporary layer of ice that supports her and immediately melts once she moves away from it.
