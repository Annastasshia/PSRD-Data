Treat this as a trip combat maneuver. If you succeed, the target is considered off balance until it recovers its balance, usually by making a Swim check on its turn. This feat has no effect on creatures with a swim speed, those using magic such as <i>freedom of movement</i>, and creatures that can't be tripped.</p>",
