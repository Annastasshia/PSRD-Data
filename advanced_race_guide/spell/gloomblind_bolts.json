You can fire one bolt, plus one for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of three bolts at 13th level) at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and require a ranged touch attack to hit. Each bolt deals 4d6 points of damage to a living creature or heals 4d6 points of damage to an undead creature. Furthermore, the bolt's energy spreads over the skin of creature, possibly blinding it for a short time. Any creature struck by a bolt must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become blinded for 1 round.</p>",
