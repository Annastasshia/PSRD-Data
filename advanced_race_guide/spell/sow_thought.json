If the idea is contrary to the target's normal thoughts (such as making a paladin think, \"I should murder my friends\") the target may suspect mind-altering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common language for the spell to succeed, but without a common language you can only sow the most basic rudimentary ideas.</p>",
