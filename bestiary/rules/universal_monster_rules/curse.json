The effects of the curse, including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature's description. If a curse allows a saving throw, it is usually a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cursing creature's racial HD + the creature's Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). Curses can be removed through <i>remove curse</i> and similar effects.</p>",
