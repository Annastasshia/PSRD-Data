While the daeodon is primarily a scavenger, it isn't averse to attacking smaller creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or those who stumble unwittingly into its territory. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as mounts, and orc cavalry mounted on dire boars make for a fearsome force indeed.
