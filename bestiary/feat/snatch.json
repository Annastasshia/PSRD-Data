If it grapples a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage with a successful grapple check. A snatched opponent held in the creature's mouth is not allowed a Reflex save against the creature's breath weapon, if it has one.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A flung creature travels 1d6 &times; 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.</p>",
