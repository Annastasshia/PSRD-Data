    "body": "<p id=\"fiend-totem,-lesser\">While raging, the barbarian grows a pair of large horns, gaining a gore attack. This attack is a primary attack (unless she is also attacking with weapons, in which case it is a secondary attack) and is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus (&ndash;5 if it is a secondary attack). The gore attack deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (1d6 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier (1/2 if it is a secondary attack).</p>",
