    "body": "<p id=\"second-chance\">At 3rd level, an acrobat can reroll any Acrobatics, Climb, or Fly skill check she has just made. This reroll is made at a &ndash;5 penalty. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability only once on any given skill check. She can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>",
