    "body": "<p id=\"berserkergang\">At 12th level, a savage skald can inspire a rapturous battle trance that suppresses pain, stunning, and fear effects for one creature, plus one additional creature per three levels after 12th. Affected creatures also gain DR 5/&mdash; (DR 10/&mdash; against nonlethal damage); this benefit stacks with the damage reduction class ability of barbarians. This mind-affecting ability requires audible components. This performance replaces soothing performance. </p>",
