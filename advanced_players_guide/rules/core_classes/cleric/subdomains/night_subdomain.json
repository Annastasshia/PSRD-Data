As long as you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you are invisible (as per <i>invisibility</i>) to creatures without darkvision. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability for a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
