You can move across any stone surface as if under the effects of <i>spider climb</i>. You can also see very well in darkness, gaining darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already possess darkvision, extend the range by 60 feet. While underground, you also gain an insight bonus equal to your cleric level on Stealth skill checks and an insight bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on initiative checks. You can use this ability for 1 minute per day per cleric level you possess. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>",
