Living creatures in this aura (except you) take 1d6 points of damage per round as their flesh rots. They also take a cumulative &ndash;1 penalty to Strength each round they remain in the aura. Once outside the aura, the penalty fades at the rate of &ndash;1 per round, but it begins building again if they reenter the aura. Plant creatures take 2d6 points of damage per round. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>",
