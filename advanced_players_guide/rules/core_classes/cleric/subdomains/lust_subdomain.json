The creature receives a Will save to negate this affect. If the save fails, the creature attacks your enemies for 1 round, gives you its most valuable item, or drops prone at your feet and grovels for 1d4 rounds (GM's choice). You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>",
