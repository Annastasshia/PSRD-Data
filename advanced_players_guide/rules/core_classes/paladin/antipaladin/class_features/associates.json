Under exceptional circumstances, an antipaladin can ally with good associates, but only to defeat them from within and bring ruin to their ranks. An antipaladin does not need an <i>atonement</i> spell during such an unusual alliance as long as his nefarious goals are met in the end&mdash;evil cares only about results. An antipaladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil.</p>",
