A creature under the effect of <i>negate aroma</i> cannot be tracked, located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. In addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities (such as those possessed by troglodytes). </p><p id=\"negate-aroma\"><i>Negate aroma</i> does not prevent the target from acquiring outside smells or odors. Dowsing the creature with a pungent substance effectively negates the benefits of the spell until the substance is neutralized or washed away.</p>",
