In addition, the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per <i>endure elements</i>) as well as extremes of pressure. </p><p id=\"life-bubble\"><i>Life bubble</i> does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater).</p><p>When you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2 hours per caster level.
