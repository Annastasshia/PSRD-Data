In addition, you make a dispel check against any <i>magic jar</i> effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell, except <i>cast out</i> can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect. </p>",
