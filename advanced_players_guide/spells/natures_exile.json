The target also takes a &ndash;10 penalty on Survival skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.</p><p id=\"nature's-exile\"><i>Nature's exile</i> can be removed with <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p>",
