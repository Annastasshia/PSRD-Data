    "body": "<p id=\"unusual-creatures-and-armor-dr\">Amorphous or incorporeal creatures have an easier time bypassing DR/armor. When they attack a creature with DR/armor, they typically treat that DR as a fraction of the DR/armor. Attacks by incorporeal creatures entirely ignore the DR unless that DR comes from a force effect or from armor with the <i>ghost touch</i> special armor quality. These traits are detailed in Table 5&ndash;3.</p>",
