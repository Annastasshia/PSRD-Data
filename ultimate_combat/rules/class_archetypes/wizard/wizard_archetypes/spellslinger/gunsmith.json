    "body": "<p id=\"gunsmith\">The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a gunslinger gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun. This ability replaces scribe scroll. </p>",
