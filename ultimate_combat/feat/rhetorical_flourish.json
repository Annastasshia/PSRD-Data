If you fail by 5 or more, you instead take a &ndash;2 penalty on your next Diplomacy check against that creature.                </p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">Alternatively, you can use this feat to retry a single failed Diplomacy check against a creature. You take a &ndash;4 penalty on your Bluff check when using Rhetorical Flourish in this way.
