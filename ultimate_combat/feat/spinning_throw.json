If your bull rush succeeds, you can move that opponent to any unoccupied square you threaten, then push that opponent the number of 5-foot increments your successful bull rush allows. The target is then knocked prone. If the bull rush fails, you can use the <i>Ki</i> Throw feat as normal.                </p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">If you also have the Improved <i>Ki</i> Throw feat, a successful bull rush allows you to push the opponent into a space secondary targets occupy. You resolve this effect as if you used the Improved <i>Ki</i> Throw feat to throw the opponent into that space.</p>",
