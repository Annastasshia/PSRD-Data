Because of this reproductive need for gemstones, crysmals are relentless in their pursuit of the treasures, valuing them much as other living creatures value infants of their own race. Crysmals do not recognize that other creatures treat gems as wealth, and attempt to seize gems carried by others whenever the opportunity arises. A crysmal normally uses its spell-like abilities to befuddle opponents, grabbing at pouches with gems when the bearer is distracted, and normally only resorts to physical violence once all other tactics fail. </p>"
