Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.</p><p>This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as <i>bless, good hope</i>, and <i>rage</i>, and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the <i>confused</i> condition from all targets<i></i>. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the <i>calm emotions</i> spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>",
