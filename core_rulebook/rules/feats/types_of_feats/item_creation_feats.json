The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</p><p align=\"center\"><b><i>Scrolls:</i> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 25 gp.</b><b><i>Potions:</i> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 50 gp.</b><b><i>Wands:</i> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 750 gp.</b><b><i>Staves:</i> The price for staves is calculated using more complex formulas (see Magic Items).</b></p><p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>",
