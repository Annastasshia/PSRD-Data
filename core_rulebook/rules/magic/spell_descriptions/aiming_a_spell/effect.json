As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don't have to see the creature you're trying to hit, as you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for the creature at which you're aiming.</p><p>If a ray spell has a duration, it's the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p><p>If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>",

When determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners.
