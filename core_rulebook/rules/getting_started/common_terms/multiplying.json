    "body": "<p id=\"multiplying\">When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.</p>",
