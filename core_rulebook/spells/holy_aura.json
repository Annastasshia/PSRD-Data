Unlike <i>protection from evil</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from evil </i>does.</p><p>Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a <i>holy aura</i>, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as <i>blindness/deafness</i>, but against <i>holy aura's </i>save DC).</p>",
