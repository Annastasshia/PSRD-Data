All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.</p><p>Alternatively, you can target <i>shatter</i> against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), <i>shatter</i> deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.</p>",
