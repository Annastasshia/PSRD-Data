Casting such a <i>miracle </i>costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>miracles </i>of this sort could include the following:</p><ul><li> Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</li>\n<li> Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.</li>\n<li> Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li></ul><p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.</p><p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a <i>miracle </i>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p>",
