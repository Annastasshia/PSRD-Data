    "text": "<p>This spell has two versions.</p><p><i>Prune Growth</i>: This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of <i>diminish plants</i> automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as <i>entangle, plant growth</i>, and <i>wall of thorns</i>.</p><p>At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.</p><p><i>Stunt Growth</i>: This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal. </p><p>This spell has no effect on plant creatures.</p>",
