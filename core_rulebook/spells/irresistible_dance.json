The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a &ndash;4 penalty to Armor Class and a &ndash;10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.</p>",
