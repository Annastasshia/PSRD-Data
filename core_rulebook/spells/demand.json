If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the <i>demand</i> is issued, the message is understood but the <i>suggestion</i> is ineffective.</p><p>The <i>demand</i>'s message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the <i>suggestion</i>. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.</p>",
