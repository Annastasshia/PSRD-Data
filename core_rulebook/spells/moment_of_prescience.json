This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the <i>moment of prescience </i>before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one <i>moment of prescience </i>active on you at the same time.</p>",
