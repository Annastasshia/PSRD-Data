You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is &ldquo;sprung&rdquo;; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.</p><p>If another <i>phantom trap</i> is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.</p>",
