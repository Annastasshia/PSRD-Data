You prepare and cast these spells normally.</p><p><i>Retain</i>You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the <i>mnemonic enhancer</i>. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.</p><p>In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).</p>",
