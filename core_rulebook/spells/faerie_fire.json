Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical <i>darkness </i>effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement, invisibility,</i> or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The <i>faerie fire </i>can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The <i>faerie fire </i>does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</p>",
