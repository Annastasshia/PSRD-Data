Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated.</p><p>If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw.

This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable.
