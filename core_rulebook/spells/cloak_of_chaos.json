Unlike <i>protection from law</i>, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.</p><p>Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.</p><p>Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as <i>protection from law </i>does.</p><p>Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is <i>confused </i>for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the <i>confusion </i>spell, but against the save DC of <i>cloak of chaos</i>).</p>",
