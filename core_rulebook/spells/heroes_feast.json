The ambrosial food grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours.</p><p>If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.</p>",
