A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.</p><p><i>Note</i>Magic traps such as <i>symbol of weakness </i>are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of weakness </i>and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for <i>symbol of weakness</i>.</p>",
