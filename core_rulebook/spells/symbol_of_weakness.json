    "text": "<p>This spell functions like <i>symbol of death</i>, except that every creature within 60 feet of a <i>symbol of weakness </i>instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.</p><p>Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of weakness </i>has no hit point limit; once triggered, a <i>symbol of weakness </i>simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.</p><p><i>Note</i>Magic traps such as <i>symbol of weakness </i>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for <i>symbol of weakness</i>.</p>",
