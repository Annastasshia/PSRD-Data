To craft a ring, you must use up raw materials costing half of the base price. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.</p>",
