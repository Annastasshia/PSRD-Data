A creature can only be healed or harmed by the symbol once in any 24-hour period. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of healing</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p>",
