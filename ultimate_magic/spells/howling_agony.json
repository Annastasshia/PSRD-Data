However, if an affected creature spends a move action screaming as loudly as possible, it can act without any other penalties for the remainder of its turn. \u201cScreaming,\u201d for the purposes of this spell, includes any vocalization of pain or its telepathic equivalent; creatures that cannot scream (such as creatures without the natural ability to communicate or vocalize) suffer the full effect of the spell.</p>",
