The animal's primal instincts take hold for the duration of this spell&mdash;if the animal knows tricks granted by the Handle Animal skill, it loses access to all of those tricks save for &ldquo;attack.&rdquo; This spell has no effect on animals that already have the advanced creature template.</p>",
