This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy ash rains down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a &ndash;4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rock and ash disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).</p>",
