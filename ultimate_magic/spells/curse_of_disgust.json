When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is aware of the trigger, it gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to leave. A successful Will save negates the urge to leave, but the sickened condition persists as long as the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and aware of it. Example triggers include beggars, filthy clothing, diseased creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats, corpses, and sewage.</p>",
