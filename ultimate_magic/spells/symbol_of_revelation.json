These creatures are outlined by a pale light that functions like <i>faerie fire</i>, except it lasts for 10 minutes per caster level; the symbol does not otherwise reveal their true form. Once triggered, a <i>symbol of revelation</i> remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of revelation</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p>",
