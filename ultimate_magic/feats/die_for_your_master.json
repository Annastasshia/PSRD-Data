If it makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack; if it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day&mdash;if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Reflex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.</p>",
