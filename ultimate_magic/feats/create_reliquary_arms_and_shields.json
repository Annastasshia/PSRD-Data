This increases the item's price by 250 gp. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast <i>consecrate</i> or <i>desecrate</i>, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.</p>",
