    "body": "<p id=\"curses-and-other-spells\">All spellblights can be inflicted upon spellcasters with a <i>bestow curse</i> or <i>major curse</i> spell. <i>Bestow curse</i> can bestow any minor spellblight, while a <i>major curse</i> is required to afflict a spellcaster with a major spellblight. Other spells may inflict a specific spellblight or may allow the caster to select any spellblight as part of the spell. A successful saving throw against the spell prevents the spellblight from taking hold.</p>",
