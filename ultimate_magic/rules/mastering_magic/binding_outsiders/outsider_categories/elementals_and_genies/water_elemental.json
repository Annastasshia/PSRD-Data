    "body": "<p id=\"water-elemental\">When summoning a water elemental, remove sources of water from the room and prepare a bonfire. A ring of fire around the <i>magic circle</i> exposes the elemental to its hated enemy the instant it appears on the Material Plane, distracting it long enough for the binder to seize control. This is an opposed Will check, granting a +1 bonus to the caster for each large fire in the room; success grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check.</p>",
