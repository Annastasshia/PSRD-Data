    "body": "<p id=\"feats\">These <i>ki</i> powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. A monk does not need to qualify for a feat to select it as a <i>ki</i> power. For example, a qinggong monk can select Spring Attack as a <i>ki</i> power even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of these <i>ki</i> powers is a free action on the monk's turn; until the start of her next turn, the monk is treated as if she had that feat. Some of these <i>ki</i> powers that duplicate feats may also be activated as an immediate action; these powers are noted in the <i>ki</i> powers list.</p>",
