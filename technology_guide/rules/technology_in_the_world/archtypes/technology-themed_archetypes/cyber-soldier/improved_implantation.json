Her brain and body slots each accommodate one more piece of cybertech than normal. In addition, her limit on implantation points increases by 1/2 his cyber-soldier level. She can allocate these points between his Intelligence and Constitution scores as she chooses. At 15th level, her body slot can accommodate two more pieces of cybertech than normal.
