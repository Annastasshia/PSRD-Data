            "text": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This airtight suit of synthetic polymers includes a transparent, dome-like helmet that completely covers the wearer's head. A spacesuit is nearly identical in function to an HEV suit, except that as long as the spacesuit is charged, it provides a bit more armor protection as well as complete protection from all radiation and exposure to vacuum. A spacesuit repairs damage to itself at the rate of 4d6 points of damage per charge consumed. It has hardness 6 and 60 hit points.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A space suit is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly speed of 20 ft. (poor) in areas of zero gravity while the spacesuit is charged. The boosters impart no benefit in areas of high, low, or normal gravity.</p>",
