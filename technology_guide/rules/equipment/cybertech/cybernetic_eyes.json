    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A cybernetic eye can be enhanced by cyberart at no additional cost, giving it an unusual color or pattern. When a pair of eyes is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks. This bonus stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks from other cybernetic senses. Cybernetic eyes grant a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against blindness and visual effects.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The listed price, implantation value, and install DC are for having two eyes installed. A single cybernetic eye costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its eyes to receive the benefits above.</p>",
