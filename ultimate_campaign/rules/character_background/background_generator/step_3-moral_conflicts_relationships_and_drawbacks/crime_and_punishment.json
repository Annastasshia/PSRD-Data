It is easiest to do this sitting around a table, with each player passing the dice clockwise until the dice have completed a full turn around the table.</p><p>You can also use this table free-form if you wish, rolling for your relationship for as many or as few of the other characters as you care to define; however, the first method guarantees that every character has connections to two other characters to improve group cohesion.</p><p>If you end up with a result that makes no sense or isn't possible, reroll or just chose another option.</p>",
