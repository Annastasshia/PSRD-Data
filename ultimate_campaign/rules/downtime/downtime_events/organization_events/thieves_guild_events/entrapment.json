You must spend 5 points of Influence or 1d10 \u00d7 5 gp to get the team out of jail; if you don't, the team members are imprisoned, or (depending on the local laws against thievery) are executed 1d10 days later. Either result costs you the entire team and 1d6 points of Influence for letting it happen. Alternatively, you can attempt to break the team out of jail&mdash;the GM should create a combat encounter or short adventure if you try this solution.</p>",
