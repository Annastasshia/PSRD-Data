This is similar to the gather information activity, except instead of looking for rumors and gossip in town, you are consulting with sages, perusing historical documents, or using magic to unearth information. Instead of a Diplomacy check, attempt one or more Knowledge checks appropriate to the intended subject. These checks can be for the same or different topics (and can use different Knowledge skills), and you can expend one of the rolls you haven't used yet to reroll a Knowledge check you failed during this activity. You have three options for researching information.</p>",
