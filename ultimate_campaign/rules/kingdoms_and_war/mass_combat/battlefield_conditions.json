The modifiers listed below apply only for the duration of the battle. Naturally, the GM should  exercise judgment regarding any conditions that don't seem to apply to one of the armies (such as darkness and an army with darkvision, or fog and an army with scent).</p><p>At the GM's discretion, large-area spells such as <i>move earth</i> might allow armies or commanders to manipulate the battlefield conditions before a conflict. For these spells to have any effect, they must last at least 1 hour and affect at least a 500-foot square. Likewise, magic items such as an <i>instant fortress</i> (+2 Defense) and spells such as <i>wall of stone</i> (+1 Defense) can create simple fortifications for an army to use in a battle.</p>",
