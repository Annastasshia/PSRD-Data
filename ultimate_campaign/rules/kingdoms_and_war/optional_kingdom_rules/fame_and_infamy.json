    "body": "<p>Kingdoms gain notoriety for the actions of their leaders and citizens, as well as for constructing certain types of buildings. This leads to the development of Fame or Infamy. Fame represents a positive perception of a kingdom&mdash;it's seen as a place of culture, learning, peace, and honor&mdash;as well as reflecting its measure of success in diplomacy, trade, and battle. Infamy represents a negative perception of a kingdom&mdash;it's perceived as treacherous, corrupt, prejudiced, ruthlessly warmongering, and villainous.</p><p>As a kingdom grows, it can gain and lose both Fame and Infamy, but these are not opposite statistics&mdash;an increase in Fame does not mean an equal decrease in Infamy. For example, a kingdom may be famous for culture and learning as well as infamous for treachery and corruption.</p>",
