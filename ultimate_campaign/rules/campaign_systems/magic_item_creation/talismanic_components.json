The value of a talismanic component from a monster should be subtracted from the monster's total treasure award for the encounter, or later encounters should award a reduced amount of treasure to make up for the value of the talismanic component.</p><p>Acquiring a talismanic component from a monster or natural feature might not be easy or automatic.

Harvesting an intact glowing crystal from a mithral vein might require a Knowledge (geology) check. Distilling heartblood from a dragon's corpse might require a Craft (alchemy) check.

Vampire ichor spoils instantly in sunlight or on holy ground.
