Instead of fleeing, undead that fail their saves might be destroyed. You destroy 2d4 Hit Dice worth of undead per tier. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first; among undead with equal HD, those that are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No undead of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that aren't sufficient to affect an undead are wasted.</p>",
