    "body": "<p id=\"mounted-maniac\">Your unstoppable momentum while mounted is terrifying. Whenever you charge a creature while mounted, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of your target, adding your tier to the result of the check. If you expend one use of mythic power, any creature demoralized by this ability is frightened instead of shaken. The duration of this condition is dependent upon your check, as noted in the Intimidate skill.</p>",
