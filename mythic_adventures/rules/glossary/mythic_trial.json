    "body": "<p>(Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A trial is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.</p>",
