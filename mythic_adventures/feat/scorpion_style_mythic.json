You can expend one use of mythic power when making your attack to slow your target, as the spell <i>slow</i>, unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). The slowing effect supersedes the normal speed penalty of your Scorpion Strike, but lasts for an equal number of rounds.</p>",
