If you successfully hit your opponent, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. You can expend one use of mythic power when you stagger a target with Medusa's Wrath to extend the duration of the staggered condition by a number of rounds equal to half your tier.</p>",
