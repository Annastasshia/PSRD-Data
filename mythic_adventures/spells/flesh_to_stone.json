The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the <i>slow</i> effect.</p><p>The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn't affect the target's gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn't.</p>",
