It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a non-mythic treant (Bestiary 266). It has only one slam attack, lacks the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities, and has the treant's vulnerability to fire. If the treant terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state. If the treant expends one use of mythic power when it animates a tree, the tree remains animated and under the treant's control up to a range of 1 mile, and it doesn't count toward the treant's limit of controlling up to two trees at a time.",
